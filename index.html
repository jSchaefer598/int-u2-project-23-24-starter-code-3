      The amount of trash on the ground is keeping the plants that are necessary for the environment from growing. The trash is covering the space that these essential plants need in order to grow. We need trees to filter carbon dioxide and turn it back into fresh air.

      Trash in the ocean causes sea creatures to get tangled up and suffocate. Sea creatures arenâ€™t the only ones affected by garbage though. Land creatures are also affected by the trash that people leave all over the ground. Animals eat trash that they find on the ground and they get tangled up in trash that they roll around in and it causes them to suffocate.
